<span class ="txt10">The library offers a free, one-to-one tutoring program for adults needing help with basic reading and comprehension and for the foreign-born who want to improve their knowledge of the English language. When volunteer tutors are available, they meet weekly with patrons seeking assistance.<br>
<br>
The library also houses an extensive collection of related resource materials for patrons interested in improving their reading readiness and comprehension, grammar, writing and English-speaking skills. The literacy materials have recently been updated to include learning tools on DVDs and CDs that patrons can take home and use at their convenience. For those studying to become American citizens, a very comprehensive <span class ="ital">Civics and Citizenship Toolkit: A Collection of Educational Resources for Immigrant</span>s is available.<br>
