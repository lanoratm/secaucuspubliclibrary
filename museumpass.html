</span>The library has a family museum pass to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York City, The Guggenheim and Brooklyn Museums, the Children's Museum of Manhattan and the Morris Museum in Morris, NJ.  These passes were donated by the Friends of the Secaucus Public Library and allow Secaucus families to visit the museums with free admission.   We require a $50 cash deposit when picking up either pass, which will be returned to you when it is brought back on time.  The pass is given out on first come, first served reservations.<br>
</span>

<span class ="txt0"><span class ="bold"><a name="How do I sign up?" class ="txt1">How do I sign up?</a><br>
</span>To reserve a pass to any museum, please contact the library and ask to be forwarded to the reference department.  We will ask you for your name, phone number, and requested day.<br>
</span>

<span class ="txt0"><span class ="bold"><a name="Who is eligible?" class ="txt1">Who is eligible?</a><br>
</span>The passes can be used by any Secaucus resident, 18 and over, with a library card in good standing.<br>
</span>


<span class ="txt0"><span class ="bold"><a name="How long do I get to keep the pass for?" class ="txt1">How long do I get to keep the pass?</a><br>
</span>The pass is loaned for 2 days during the week.  Those using the pass on the weekends pick up the pass on Friday and return it on Monday. <br/>
<br />
Special time restrictions may be put in place for busy school holiday weeks or weeks containing library closures for federal holidays, in order to accommodate as many families as possible. Please confirm the borrowing schedule when picking up passes during these weeks.

    We have two passes to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum located on the West side of Manhattan on Pier 86, 12th Ave. and 46th Street in New York City.  Each pass allows for up to six people, regardless of age, to visit for free.  There are no additional discounts with this pass. <strong>Please note that this pass does not include entrance to see the space shuttle Enterprise.</strong><span class ="bold"><br>
  <br>
  </span>
   The Guggenheim art museum is located at 1071 Fifth Avenue in New York City.  Up to five people may visit this museum for free.  In addition, there are discounts at the museum's store and cafe. <br>

</span><span class ="ital">Can I borrow the passes on a walk-in basis?<br>
</span>Usually not.  This is a very popular program and the passes are booked weeks (sometimes months) in advance.  However, cancellations do occur, so it is best to call us to see if we can accommodate you.<span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
 Can I borrow more than one pass at a time? <br /> </span>

Since we only have a small number of passes available at any given time, we ask library users to only reserve one pass for each two-day time slot. However, a pass to a second museum (if available) may be borrowed on a walk-in basis when the reserved pass is picked up.  <span class ="ital">
<br />
<br />
Do you have tickets?<br>
</span>No, we do not have individual tickets for the museums.  The program uses library membership passes that we loan out to those who reserve each pass in advance.  <span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
Do I need to have a library card in order to use the pass?<br>
</span>Yes.  To visit the Intrepid museum, you must present your Secaucus Library card when showing the membership badge at the admission counter.  Other museums may or may not ask to see a library card; however, we encourage all Secaucus residents to get a library card -- because it's the best card to have! When picking up the pass, we will check your library card account to make sure there are no outstanding fines or overdues.  We require a library card in good standing as part of our pass program.<span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
What do I do if I can't pick up the pass or I need to change the date that I want to go?<br>
</span>If you can't pick up the pass personally, you may designate another family member or friend, over the age of 18, to pick it up. If you are unable to visit the museum during the days that you have reserved the pass, please call the library as soon as possible to cancel or postpone your reservation, so that we can make the pass available to others. <span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
Does everyone that is visiting the museum with me need to be a Secaucus resident or a family member?<br>
</span>No, only the person responsible for the pass needs to be a resident.<span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
What if there's a cancellation?<br>
</span>Just call us, Monday-Friday and we can let you know if there are any openings. Our usual pick-up days for passes are on Tuesdays and Fridays, so the best chances of getting a last-minute booking are on Tuesday and Friday evenings, or on Wednesday and Saturday mornings.<span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
What do I do if I lose the pass while I am borrowing it?<br>
</span>When you pick up the pass, you will fill out a contract stipulating that you are responsible for the pass and in the event it is lost or stolen, you will assume the entire cost of replacing it.&nbsp; A lost American Museum of Natural History pass will cost $115.00.&nbsp; A lost Intrepid pass is $50.00 and a lost Guggenheim/Brooklyn Museum pass is $250.00.<span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
What time do I have to pick up and return the pass?<br>
</span>When you pick up the pass, you will fill out a contract stipulating that you are responsible for the pass and in the event it is lost or stolen, you will assume the entire cost of replacing it. Replacement costs vary by museum, and range from a lost Intrepid pass fee of $50.00 to a Guggenheim/Brooklyn Museum pass replacement fee of $250.00.&nbsp; <span class ="ital"><br>
<br>
What hours are the museums open and how do I get there?<br>
</span>You must pick up the pass no later than 8:45pm on the day of your reservation.  The pass must be returned no later than 8:45pm on the return date. Special time restrictions may be put in place during busy school holiday weeks, in order to accommodate as many families as possible. Please confirm the borrowing schedule when picking up passes during school holiday weeks. Returning passes late will forfeit your $50.00 deposit.  .<br>
