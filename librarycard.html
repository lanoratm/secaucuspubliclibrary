</span>If you live, work or go to school in Secaucus, you are eligible for a card.&nbsp; We require two proofs of Secaucus residency, one with a photo identification.&nbsp; We do not accept post office box addresses.&nbsp; If you work in town, we require proof of current employment.&nbsp; Those Secaucus employees who live in a town within the BCCLS network, you do not need to apply for a Secaucus library card.&nbsp; Your card works here just like your home library!<br>
